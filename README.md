Small script to generate random binary files

I have created this to test if I could find a random generated file
thas was executable, even if it's against the odds it would be pretty
cool if a full executable file was found totally by random. 

Didn't find one anyway (◔_◔)

Be careful when running this though, I recommend executing in a VM
because it's not impossible to it to remove an archive even if it's
one in a billion chance
